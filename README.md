# Bayesian-Analysis-of-Housing-Price-Prediction
This project uses Bayesian analysis to predict housing prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, neighborhood, and year built. It applies two models: one with uninformative Gaussian priors and another with modified priors, exploring the impact of different priors on model performance.
